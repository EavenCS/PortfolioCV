## Why I have developed the site?
As a software developer, it's important to have an up-to-date and professional online presence to impress potential employers and clients. A personalized CV website provides the opportunity to showcase your skills, projects and experience in a clear and engaging way. It puts you in control of your online reputation and allows you to market your brand and skills. Moreover, with a dedicated CV website, you can also provide your networking contacts and references. In short, a personalized CV website is an important part of the modern job search process and helps you attract the attention of potential employers.
